Aphelios begins the game with Calibrum as his main weapon and Severum in his off-hand, with Gravitum, Infernum and Crescendum queued in reserve. The queue order can be rearranged based on weapon usage. Weapons spawn with 50 Moonlight for ammunition, which is consumed on basic attacks or to cast his Q abilities. Abilities that cause Aphelios to attack do not cost additional Moonlight on top of their ability cost. Once his main weapon is exhausted of Moonlight, it is moved to the end of the queue and Aphelios equips the next available weapon from his reserve. Aphelios cannot improve his abilities with skill points. He starts the game with Phase and gains access to Q abilities at level 2. He gains access to Moonlight Vigil at level 6, which improves automatically at levels 11 and 16.

IVERN;FRIEND OF THE FOREST;Passive;Ivern cannot attack or damage non-epic monsters. Instead, targeting a jungle camp initiates a 2.5-second channel that, upon completion, places the monsters within a grove. Placing a grove costs 131.63 − 121 (based on level) health and 148.5 − 110.25 (based on level) mana, and cannot be cast if Ivern lacks the resources. The grove matures over 40-30s (at levels 1-6), 27-15s (at levels 7-11), 11-3s (at levels 12-14), 1s (level 15+). When fully matured, Ivern can interact with the camp again to instantly free the monsters, sending them away while receiving their full gold and experience bounty. Smiting a camp within a grove will instantly free the monsters, regardless of its maturity or the monster's current health. If the camp's large monster has already been slain, Ivern will free the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the grove will instantly mature if the large monster is slain. Starting at level 5, freeing the Red Brambleback or Blue Sentinel leaves behind a sapling that can be picked up by an allied champion to gain the camp's buff, consuming it in the process. If at least one allied champion is nearby, Ivern can pick up the sapling to transfer it to the nearest one in range. If an ally kills either monster, they also leave behind a sapling that only Ivern can consume.;;;;
